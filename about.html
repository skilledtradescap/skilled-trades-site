      <h2>About Skilled Trades Growth Capital</h2>
      <p>
        Skilled Trades Growth Capital is an emerging, Maryland-focused initiative exploring how to bring
        flexible, revenue-based financing to established local trade businesses. The goal is simple:
        help strong HVAC, plumbing, electrical, roofing, and home-service companies grow without forcing
        owners to sell equity or rely solely on rigid bank debt.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Why skilled trades, and why Maryland?</h3>
      <p>
        Skilled-trade businesses are essential to the functioning of every community. They keep homes
        heated and cooled, water running, electrical systems safe, and properties maintained. In Maryland,
        demographic trends, electrification, and infrastructure needs are all contributing to strong,
        sustained demand for these services.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, many trade businesses struggle to access growth capital that matches the way
        their businesses actually work. Asset-light models, uneven paperwork, and seasonal revenue
        patterns do not always fit neatly into conventional lending criteria—even when the underlying
        business is healthy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Our approach</h3>
      <p>
        Rather than starting with a large fund or complex structure, this initiative is being developed
        gradually and carefully, focusing first on:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style:none; padding-left:0; color:#4b5563; font-size:0.95rem;">
        <li>• Understanding the needs and constraints of Maryland trade owners</li>
        <li>• Testing simple, transparent revenue-based structures</li>
        <li>• Maintaining clear alignment between owners and investors</li>
        <li>• Keeping documentation and process as straightforward as possible</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-top:0.75rem;">
        Over time, the aim is to refine a model that works consistently for both sides and can potentially
        be scaled or replicated, while keeping a clear focus on real-economy impact: stronger local businesses,
        better-quality jobs, and more resilient Maryland communities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Where things stand today</h3>
      <p>
        At this stage, Skilled Trades Growth Capital is an exploratory effort rather than a fully launched
        fund. Any potential transaction would be evaluated individually, and any investment opportunities
        would be offered only in compliance with applicable laws and to appropriately qualified investors.
      </p>
      <p style="color:#6b7280; font-size:0.9rem;">
        Nothing on this site should be understood as a commitment to provide financing or as an offer or
        solicitation to buy or sell any security.
      </p>
